                the great motion designers of the time.These interests
                led me to develop a personal aesthetic and introduced me to the world of Creative

            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>Before I decided to enroll for coding classes at Moringa School,I was a student at <a
                    href="http://tukenya.ac.ke/">The Technical University of kenya</a> pursuing a
                bachelors degree in <strong>Geospatial Engineering.</strong>I have over 2 years of solid
                experience in GIS,Remote sensing and surveying having served in various organizations as
                an intern.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="coding">
            <h4>Why programming?</h4>
            <p>I have always wanted to become a great GIS programmer,but I didn't know where to
                start.With a background in Geospatial Engineering,skills in programming come in handy as
                they help in
                making of location based web applications,analyzing of different types of data and
                automation of Geospatial processes.Therefore,learning how to code has simply made me to
                become a versatile Geospatial Engineer.</p>
