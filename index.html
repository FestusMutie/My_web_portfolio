                            <h4>Background</h4>
                            <p>Before I decided to enroll for coding classes at Moringa School,I was a student at <a
                                    href="http://tukenya.ac.ke/">The Technical University of kenya</a> pursuing a
                                bachelors degree in <strong>Geospatial Engineering.</strong>I have over 2 years of solid
                                experience in GIS,Remote sensing and surveying having served in various organizations as
                                an intern.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="coding">
                            <p>I have always wanted to become a great GIS programmer,but I didn't know where to start.With a background in Geospatial Engineering,skills in programming come in handy as they help in
                                making of location based web applications,analyzing of different types of data and
                                automation of Geospatial processes.Therefore,learning how to code has simply made me to become a versatile Geospatial Engineer.</p>
